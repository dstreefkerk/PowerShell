.SYNOPSIS
Copies CRL files from a Windows Enterprise PKI up to Azure AD Blob Storage using AzCopy

.DESCRIPTION 
This script was written to facilitate a highly-available Azure-based CDP and AIA
location instead of the traditional technique of hosting CRLs and AIAs on
internal web servers and/or opening them up to the Internet through
a DMZ or via a reverse proxy like Azure AD App Proxy.

Requirements:
  1. AzCopy 10+ installed on the CA server - http://aka.ms/azcopy
  2. Outbound HTTPS from the CA server to Azure Blob Storage
  3. An Azure Storage Account with blob storage configured for HTTP access
  4. A folder in the blob storage named 'pki' (https://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/pki/)
  5. A SAS key with read/write/change access to blob storage only (don't assign more access than necessary)
  6. A scheduled task running hourly as NETWORK SERVICE to call this PowerShell script
  7. Create a folder in %PROGRAMDATA% called ScriptLogs, and give NETWORK SERVICE [Modify] rights

Ensure that you update the first two variables below with valid details pointing to your
Azure blob storage.

The benefit of using AzCopy is that we can have it copy files up to Azure only if
they've changed, thereby avoiding the need to do any complex file/date comparisons or
incur additional data transfer costs.

Note that if you change your storage account key, you'll need to regenerate your SAS key.

This script will copy the verbose AzCopy log for successful or failed transfers to %appdata%\ScriptLogs
(It won't log anything when 0 files were copied)

If your CA server uses Windows in a language other than English you'll need to adjust the logging code to look
for the correct text strings in the AzCopy output.
