.SYNOPSIS
Create-EventViewerCustomViews - Creates local event viewer custom view files based on Palantir's WEF Github repo
.DESCRIPTION
Palantir have a great Github repo that contains WEF (Windows Event Forwarding) subscriptions to be created on
a WEC (Windows Event Collector) server. They've done the hard work of setting up event log filters
to capture various events. https://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding

I'd recently been wondering if it was possible to push out custom Event Viewer views, and at the same time
decided I'd like to leverage the work Palantir had done with WEF/WEC to create custom view files
that allow you to filter local or remote event logs using Event Viewer.

Rather than create these views manually, this script does the following:
    1. Downloads the Palantir 'windows-event-forwarding' repo in ZIP format
    2. Extracts the Event Log query out of each file in the 'wef-subscriptions' folder, and
       turns it into a custom Event Viewer view (XML) file in %PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views

YMMV with this, as I couldn't test the actual outbound connectivity and download functionality on my work
laptop. My Windows Firewall policies don't allow PowerShell to communicate out to the Internet. I have, however,
tested the script from line #63 onwards.

Needs to be run as an admin in order to create the view files in %PROGRAMDATA%, unless you change the 
output path in the $templateStoragePath variable

.OUTPUTS
Places custom view files into %PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views
