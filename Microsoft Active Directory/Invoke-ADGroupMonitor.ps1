# Helper script for Monitor-ADGroupMemberShip.ps1
# from https://github.com/lazywinadmin/Monitor-ADGroupMembership/blob/master/Monitor-ADGroupMemberShip.ps1
#
# Dynamically builds up the list of AD groups to monitor, ensuring that we're catching
# all of the relevant groups, and that no new ones slip through the cracks.
#
# This script, Monitor-ADGroupMembership.ps1, and the resulting text file should be stored in C:\Scripts\Monitor-ADGroupMemberShip
#
# You can use https://github.com/dstreefkerk/PowerShell/blob/master/New-ScheduledScriptByMSA.ps1 to run this
# on a schedule using a gMSA
#
# This script first updates the groups text file, and then runs the Monitor-ADGroupMemberShip.ps1 script
