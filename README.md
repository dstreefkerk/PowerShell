I've recently removed a bunch of old content and reorganised what's here. If you're after any old IT admin-style scripts that I previously hosted here, you can check them out in the repo history.

Some of these scripts might still reference my old Twitter handle and my old IT blog which is now defunct. My current blog can be found at https://dstreefkerk.github.io
