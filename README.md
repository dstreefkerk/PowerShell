# PowerShell Repository Overview

This repository contains a variety of PowerShell scripts and resources, organised by topic and technology area.

## Key Resources

**PowerShell Scripting Best Practices.md** - A comprehensive guide for creating high-quality PowerShell scripts. This document serves as an excellent reference for LLMs and developers to ensure scripts follow best practices for readability, maintainability, and security.

I've recently removed a bunch of old content and reorganised what's here. If you're after any old IT admin-style scripts that I previously hosted here, you can check them out in the repo history.

Some of these scripts might still reference my old Twitter handle and my old IT blog which is now defunct and should no longer be accessible online. My current blog can be found at https://dstreefkerk.github.io
